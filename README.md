# StockNNetpredict
• Developing a basic RNN model with LSTM cells to predict stock prices of a company based on HLOC data
• Project is done in 3 stages: First identification and processing of HLOC data loaded using Panadas and Numpy, then building the Neural Net model using keras from TensorFlow and finally model is compiled, and the success is measured based on outputted RMSE value
• Testing and Predicted Values are plotted using the Matplotlib library, to understand data fluctuation better
