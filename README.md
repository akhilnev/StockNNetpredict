## Overview
This project leverages the power of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implemented in TensorFlow and Keras to predict stock prices. The primary objective is to train a model capable of forecasting future stock prices based on historical trends.

## Data Preparation
The journey begins by loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The 'close' prices are then normalized using Min-Max scaling. Sequences and labels are crafted from the scaled data, utilizing a sequence length of 60 days for the LSTM model. Finally, the dataset is meticulously split into training and testing sets.

## LSTM Model Architecture
The core of the project lies in the LSTM model, featuring two layers of 128 units each. A dash of ReLU activation functions enhances the network's capabilities, while strategically placed dropout layers prevent overfitting. The output layer, a Dense layer with a linear activation function, perfectly aligns with regression tasks. The model is fine-tuned using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

## Training
Witness the model's evolution through 20 epochs, with a batch size of 32 ensuring a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks come into play, adding finesse to the training process.

## Prediction and Visualization
Marvel as the trained model predicts stock prices on the test set. Predictions are gracefully inverse-transformed to their original scale for seamless comparison with actual prices. The results are unveiled using Matplotlib, presenting a captivating plot of actual versus predicted stock prices over time.

## Ongoing Development
Embark on a journey of continuous refinement. Acknowledging the complexity of stock prediction, the current architecture remains a canvas for ongoing modifications aimed at achieving superior accuracy. Additional sections delve into the visual representation of training and validation losses over epochs.

## Visualization and Future Work
Dive into the visual narrative of actual and predicted stock pricesâ€”a mesmerizing time series plot awaits. As the project concludes, the README emphasizes that the model is a dynamic work in progress, with relentless efforts focused on refining its architecture and unlocking greater predictive potential.

## Note
This stock prediction initiative is a holistic pursuit, not tailored to a specific company. The README underlines an unwavering commitment to refining model architecture and exploring avenues to boost prediction accuracy.
