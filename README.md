# StockNNetpredict

Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network implemented in TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to train a model to predict future stock prices based on historical trends.

Data Preparation
The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame, and the 'close' prices are normalized using Min-Max scaling. Sequences and labels are then created from the scaled data, with a sequence length of 60 days chosen for the LSTM model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets.

LSTM Model Architecture
The LSTM model consists of two layers of 128 units each, with a ReLU activation function. Dropout layers are introduced to prevent overfitting. The output layer is a Dense layer with a linear activation function, suitable for regression tasks. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.

Training
The model is trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32. Early stopping and learning rate reduction callbacks are implemented to improve training efficiency.

Prediction and Visualization
The trained model is used to predict stock prices on the test set. Predictions are then inverse-transformed to their original scale for comparison with actual prices. The results are visualized using Matplotlib, showing a plot of actual versus predicted stock prices over time.

Ongoing Development
The project acknowledges that stock prediction is a complex task, and the current architecture is subject to further modifications for improved accuracy. The code also includes additional sections for visualizing the training and validation losses over epochs.

Visualization and Future Work
The project concludes with visualizations of the actual and predicted stock prices, both as a time series plot and a comparison of training and validation losses. The README emphasizes that the model is a work in progress, with ongoing efforts to refine its architecture and enhance predictive performance.

Note

The stock prediction here is a general endeavor and not tailored to a specific company. Continuous efforts are dedicated to refining the model architecture and exploring ways to enhance prediction accuracy
